Collaborator talks
================================

### Knowledge inference for optimizing and enforcing secure computations
* presented by Mike Hicks at the 2013 meeting of the International Technology Alliance

### Knowledge inference for optimizing secure multi-party computation
Aseem Rastogi gave a talk based on our work on secure computation {% cite rastogi13knowledge --linkdetails %}. Here are [<img class="icon" src="/images/icon_pptx.png"/>the slides](/docs/rastogi13knowledge.pres.pptx) he used. [Aseem Rastogi](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~aseem/) and [Matthew Hammer](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hammer/) are continuing work on secure computation.
