  ABSTRACT = {In secure multi-party computation, mutually distrusting
                  parties cooperatively compute functions of their
                  private data; in the process, they only learn
                  certain results as per the protocol (e.g., the final
                  output). The realization of these protocols uses
                  cryptographic techniques to avoid leaking
                  information between the parties. A protocol for a
                  secure computation can sometimes be optimized
                  without changing its security guarantee: when the
                  parties can use their private data and the revealed
                  output to infer the values of other data, then this
                  other data need not be concealed from them via
                  cryptography. } # break # {In the context of
                  automatically optimizing secure multi-party

                  inference. In both problems, we attempt to
                  automatically discover when and if intermediate
                  variables used in a protocol will (eventually) be
                  known to the parties involved in the computation.

  ABSTRACT = {This paper explores the idea of knowledge-based
                  security policies, which are used to decide whether
                  to answer queries over secret data based on an
                  estimation of the querier's (possibly increased)
                  knowledge given the results. Limiting knowledge is
                  the goal of existing information release policies
                  that employ mechanisms such as noising,
                  anonymization, and redaction. Knowledge-based
                  policies are more general: they increase flexibility
                  by not fixing the means to restrict information
                  flow. We enforce a knowledge-based policy by
                  explicitly tracking a model of a querier's belief
                  about secret data, represented as a probability
                  distribution, and denying any query that could
                  increase knowledge above a given threshold. We
                  implement query analysis and belief tracking via
                  abstract interpretation, which allows us to trade
                  off precision and performance through the use of
                  abstraction. We have developed an approach to
                  augment standard abstract domains to include
                  probabilities, and thus define distributions. We
                  focus on developing probabilistic polyhedra in
                  particular, to support numeric programs. While
                  probabilistic abstract interpretation has been
                  considered before, our domain is the first whose
                  design supports sound conditioning, which is
                  required to ensure that estimates of a querier's
                  knowledge are accurate. Experiments with our
                  implementation show that several useful queries can
                  be handled efficiently, particularly compared to
                  exact (i.e., sound) inference involving sampling. We
                  also show that, for our benchmarks, restricting
                  constraints to octagons or intervals, rather than
                  full polyhedra, can dramatically improve performance
                  while incurring little to no loss in precision.}

                  comfortable with. Almost all previous work on SMC
                  treats f as given. Left unanswered is the question
                  of how parties should decide whether it is ``safe''
                  for them to compute f in the first place. } # break

                  reason about the increase in knowledge that other
                  parties could gain as a result of computing f, and
                  may choose not to participate (or participate only
                  partially) so as to restrict that gain in knowledge.
                  We develop two techniques-the belief set method and
                  the SMC belief tracking method-prove them sound, and

  ABSTRACT = {Interaction between entities who may not trust each
                  other is now commonplace on the Internet. This paper
                  focuses on the specific problem of sharing
                  information between distrusting parties. Previous
                  work in this area shows that privacy and utility can
                  co-exist, but often do not provide strong assurances
                  of one or the other. In this paper, we sketch a
                  research agenda with several directions for
                  attacking these problems, considering several
                  alternative systems that examine the privacy vs.
                  utility problem from different angles. We consider
                  new mechanisms such as economic incentives to share
                  data or discourage data leakage and a hybrid of
                  code-splitting and secure multi-party computation to
                  provide various assurances of secrecy. We discuss
                  how to incorporate these mechanisms into practical
                  applications, including online social networks, a
                  recommendation system based on users' qualifications
                  rather than identities, and a personal information
                  broker that monitors data leakage over time. We hope
                  that this paper will spark ideas and conversation at
                  ACITA about directions most worth pursuing. }
